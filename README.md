My workplace has a beautiful view through the window and a cozy desktop setup.

However, my iPhone 11 struggled to capture both bright and dark areas in a single shot. 
So, I decided to create an HDR image myself!

The challenge? 
I took six different pictures without a tripod, resulting a blurry result. 
But honestly, who uses a tripod for iPhone photos these days?

To fix this, I applied a feature matching methodâ€”and it worked perfectly!

My workplace has a beautiful view through the window and a cozy desktop setup.

However, my iPhone 11 struggled to capture both bright and dark areas in a single shot. 
So, I decided to create an HDR image myself!

The challenge? 
I took six different pictures without a tripod, resulting a blurry result. 
But honestly, who uses a tripod for iPhone photos these days?

To fix this, I applied a feature matching methodâ€”and it worked perfectly!

ðŸ“· About the Images

Numbers only â†’ Original photos taken with an iPhone 11, labeled by EV values.
Aligned_n â†’ Images aligned relative to image 0 for better HDR processing.

The exposure values (EV) converted into exposure time for HDR image processing.

ðŸ”¹ Exposure Value to Exposure Time Conversion
EV List: [0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.0]
Exposure Time (seconds): [0.0100, 0.0119, 0.0151, 0.0200, 0.0246, 0.0317, 0.0400]
